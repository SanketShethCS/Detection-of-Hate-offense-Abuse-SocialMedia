This is a readme for the main classifier code named NLP_project.py

This file is written in python and requires the data file named labeled_data.csv
to run along with many packages like pandas,nltk,scikit learn readil available
in anaconda and spyder. 

The file contains two modules primarily one is for training the model on the given data
which has to be in a specific format as stated in the data readme and then tests unseen data 
in same format to analyze the accuracy and results acheived on the model.
The training module is commented initially as there is an already tarined module
pickled and ready to be tested on provided in the folder named Project_Classifier_model.sav

The code is commented and each parts are explained.
