This is a Readme for the auxiliary files listed below-
-Experiment.py
-seperate_0_1.py
-seperate_0_2.py
-seperate_1_2.py

For the first one that is experiment.py, this file is purely for
experimentation and only requires the labeled_data.csv along with 
other python packages readily available with anaconda and spyder to
run. This file has a feature,classifier and model bank that are commented
at the end of the code that can be used to replace modules in the present code 
also provided in the same experiment.py file to run various combinations
of features and models to check out results and perform analysis.


For the rest of the files, these files are purely for testing the effects
of skewing and normalizing the data and only requires the labeled_data.csv 
along with  other python packages readily available with anaconda and spyder to
run. This files are named in such a way that the two number seperated by an 
underscore represent the two labels compared in a binary classification problem.
Also there is code commented for nomrmalizing the data in order to use that 
comment the indicated code and uncomment the normalizing code to run and analyze
the results achieved through that process.

Note- These 4 files has uncommented code as they are beyond the project and 
have just been provided as a source of justification for few of the results
stated in the report.
